<h1>Web Automation Using Python</h1>

<p> In this repository, I keep all the web automation codes written using Python 3.7.5. These codes have been compiled in a UNIX platform. Hence, users are requested to change the geckodriver path settings as per their Operating System <p>
<p> While one code uses Selenium web driver, the other one uses RoboBrowser library for browser interaction</p>
